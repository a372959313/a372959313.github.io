I’m currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), working with Professor Xizhi Liu. I received my Ph.D. in mathematics from East China Normal University, where I was fortunate to be advised by Professor Changhong Lu. Before that, I earned my B.S. degree—also from East China Normal University—in 2018.
